## Inspiration

For HackViolet 2023, we created a web-application called **Fert**, which provides aspiring and experienced gardeners with a platform to learn new skills and share their knowledge. We were inspired to build this project to encourage people to grow food in their own homes. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations - FOA - the world will need to produce `70%` more food for an additional `2.3 billion` people by `2050`. This goal is difficult to achieve with already rampant poverty and hunger, as well as climate change. This motivated us to create a web-application that could motivate people to harvest in their own backyards. The name for our project, **Fert**, is inspired by the word ‘fertilizer,’ where clients can also use it as a verb. Examples include “Have you ferted today?” or “Put your fert on the dirt!”

## What it does

Fert initially helps users to start planting by recommending different plants based on the user’s location and climate conditions. It then adds selected plants to the user’s plant catalog. In the catalog, plants are displayed as cards which include planting instructions and a time lapse. The time lapse compiles stored photos of a certain plant as a slideshow to display a timeline of the plant’s growth. It also provides users the ability to interact with others in the plant community and get advice on whether their plants’ health.

## How we built it

We primarily built the web-application using React. First, we designed collaboratively wireframes on Figma. Next, using Visual Studio Code’s Live Share feature, our team constructed a basic HTML skeleton of the website to get an overall layout of the website. Using customized components from MaterialUI, we then completed our basic layout. The plant suggestion feature was implemented using FrostLine open source API to take a given ZIP code and retrieve its corresponding plant hardiness zone.

## Challenges we ran into

- disagreements with our initial UI/UX Figma design
- integrating `.svg` files into React
  -lack of accessible APIs related our topic
- deprecated libraries

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to systematically delegate duties and create a functional web application within 24 hours. If one of us was struggling, we all worked to alleviate their burden and help each other out.

Our web application also helps users find what plant hardiness zone they are in. This is important to help new planters determine what plants would be best suited for their environment. This unique feature allows for an inclusive experience that allows for any user to find what plant works best for them.

## What we learned

Aside from applying our past knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we learned how to utilize REST API’s to gather essential information for our application’s main functionality. We utilized GitHub as our source control software for this project, which involved coordination and communication between our team members to maintain error-free source code.

## What's next for Fert

One of our original intentions for Fert was to allow for more communication between users similar to any other social media platform (e.g. comments, likes, etc.). We decided not to prioritize this process as we had many concerns over the possibility of cyberbullying and harassment. Given more time, we would love to implement means for users to communicate and encourage each other to plant more. Having a social feed with daily pictures of plants would be beneficial in keeping track of the health of your own plant as well as seeing what types of foods other people are planting. Others could react to these daily pictures using certain emojis, thus encouraging the user to keep harvesting in their backyard.
